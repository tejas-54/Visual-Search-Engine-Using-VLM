# Visual-Search-Engine-Using-VLM
This project implements a visual search engine leveraging state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) to retrieve relevant images based on textual queries or sample images. The system embeds both text and images into a shared representation space, allowing for semantic search across modalities.

# Uses in the Apparel Domain  
This visual search system transforms apparel shopping by allowing customers to find clothing items from inspiration photos, eliminating the need to describe fashion details with text. Shoppers can discover similar styles at different price points, receive outfit recommendations, and find complementary accessories based on visual analysis. For retailers, the technology increases conversion rates by showing visually relevant products, reduces returns through better expectation matching, and creates a seamless bridge between in-store browsing and online purchasing.

## Features:  
__Multi-Modal Search:__ Query using either text descriptions or example images  
__Semantic Understanding:__ Find images based on conceptual meaning, not just keywords  
__Efficient Retrieval:__ Fast similarity search using approximate nearest neighbors  
__Intuitive Web Interface:__ Simple UI for uploading images or entering text queries
